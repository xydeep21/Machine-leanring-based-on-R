# Machine-learning-based-on-R or Python 
This repository contains machine learning models based on R or Python with a simple dataset
The idea is to understand the model, how to build up a model, how to build a model based on its algorithm, how to use build-in packages, how to tuning hyper parameters, how to deal with the variance and bias trade-off, and how to evaluate different models.
